# Appointment System - API

The focus point behind this project is to make an appointment system to allow companies to manage their workflow and clientele more efficiently. This component of the system focuses on a panel designed for the staff members to interact with the data stored in their database.

This component is a REST API that will be used by the staff/client web portal and the mobile application components which will access information to present to the user. The information from this service will be produced from the database deliverable which stores any information that is required to be accessed in multiple locations.
